// This class provides the 'organising class' for the MVButtonView, including initialising and providing the sizing/positioning of MVButtonView
// This controller adds the MVButtonView (with it's subViews) as subView to TouchWheelView
// it is itself initialised by the TouchWheelView receiving from it the frame, wheelWidth and margins; the sizeButtonView func is called from TWV.draw
// it is the Delegate of touchWheel receiving the scoreValue and passing it to buttonView to display
// MVButtonView contains the scoreLabel and initiates the MVButton itself based on position and size it received from it's controller
